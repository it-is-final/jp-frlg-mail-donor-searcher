# Donor Search
This tool searches the LCRNG for donor Pokémon whose PIDs are suitable for the ACE setup on Japanese FireRed/LeafGreen.

The original Japanese blog post containing more tools for the setup can be found [here](http://detelony.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-29.html), and the video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9d4AyI2l1A).

If you prefer the tools to be in English, WIP English tools can be found [here](https://github.com/it-is-final/jpn-frlg-helper) with an English guide [here](https://github.com/it-is-final/jpn-frlg-helper/blob/main/docs/ace-setup.md).
